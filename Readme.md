The goal of this assignment was to create an interactive quiz. The player selects "start quiz" which loaded the first question and initiate a countdown timer. If the player selects incorrectly the 5 second is subtracted from the countdown timer and the next question is loaded and so on... After the player completes the last question they will be propted to enter their initial. Upon submit, the players initial are concatinated with score and stored in highscores list. The player will also be taken to a new html page where scores are listed, and the player is given the option to go back to the start of the quiz or clear the high scores list. 

Javascript concepts used:
- eventlisteners
- setInterval (for timers)
- use of localstorage.setItem and localstorage.getItem
- JSON stringify and parse
